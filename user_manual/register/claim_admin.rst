Claim Administrators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The register contains employees of contractual health facilities responsible for preparation and/or submission of claims. Administration of the register of claim administrators is restricted to users with the system role of Scheme Administrator or with a role including an access to Administration/Claim Administrators.

Pre-conditions
""""""""""""""

  A claim administrator may be added after the agreement of a contractual health facility and the management of the scheme administration. Entry of a claim administrator in the register of claim administrators doesn’t mean that the claim administrator can login to IMIS. He/she has to be entered also in the register of users. It is facilitated by the ability to create the entry of a claim administrator into the register of claim administrators and the register of users simultaneously.

Navigation
""""""""""

  All functionality for use with the administration of claim administrators can be found under the main menu ``Administration``, submenu ``Claim Administrators``.
