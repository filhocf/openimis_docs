    Distribution Period
      Distribution periods may be entered for general care (``Hospitals`` and ``Non-hospitals``), or for hospital care (``Hospitals``) only and/or for non-hospital care (``Non-Hospitals``) only. Select from the list (**NONE, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly**), the period that is to be used for calculation of the actual value of relative prices for the insurance product; by clicking on the arrow on the right.

By selecting **Monthly, Quarterly** or **Yearly** will cause a pop-up (:numref:`image14`) with the relative periods (1 period for yearly, 4 for quarterly, 12 for monthly). Percentages should be entered to indicate the distribution over the periods as per the product description. Enter to each field an appropriate percentage of paid contributions for policies of the insurance product allocated proportionally to corresponding calendar period. It means, for example, that in case of the distribution **Monthly** we put in each slot percentage of paid contributions of the insurance product that are allocated to the corresponding month and that is to be used for calculation of relative prices.

      It is not required to enter a value in each period, zero values are accepted. Once all the percentage values have been entered, click on the button OK to submit the values to the respective grid. Clicking on the button ``Cancel`` will cancel the action closing the popup and cancelling the change in the distribution.

    Sub Level 4
      The sub-level of the fourth level of health facilities can be selected that should be included in calculation of capitation payments. If the sub level is not selected, all health facilities of the specified level are included irrespective of their sub-level.

    *Note. The capitation formula is defined as follows:*

      :math:`\text{CapitationPayment}_{i} = \sum_{a}^{\ }{(\ \text{Indicator}_{i}^{a}} \times \frac{AllocatedContribution \times ShareContribution \times \text{Share}^{a}}{\sum_{i}^{\ }{\text{In}\text{dicator}}_{i}^{a}})`

      *Where*

      :math:`\text{CapitationPayment}_{i}` *is the amount of capitation payment for i-th health facility*

      :math:`\text{Indicator}_{i}^{a}` *is the value of the indicator of the type a for the i-th health facility.* :math:`\text{Indicator}_{i}^{a}`

      *may be:*

        - *Population living in catchments area of the health facility*
        - *Number of families living in catchments area of the health facility*
        - *Insured population living in catchments area of the health facility*
        - *Insured number of families living in catchments area of the health facility*
        - *Number of claims (contacts) with the health facility by insured in the catchment area*
        - *Adjusted amount*\

      :math:`\text{AllocatedContribution}` *is the amount of contributions for given insurance product for given period*

      :math:`\text{ShareContribution}` *is the formula parameter Share of contribution*

      :math:`\text{Share}^{a}` *is the weight of the indicator of the type a .*

      :math:`\text{Share}^{a}` *may be:*

      - *Weight of Population*
      - *Weight of Number of Families*
      - *Weight of Insured Population*
      - *Weight of Number of Insured Families*
      - *Weight of Number of Visits*
      - *Weight of Adjusted Amount*
