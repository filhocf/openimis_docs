Dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^

  Dimensions represent our point of view on facts. Each dimension has several values (points). The points are used for qualification of our view on the facts. AR-IMIS provides values of facts corresponding to specified points across one or more dimensions. The points may be organized in hierarchies. Lower levels of a hierarchy allow looking at a fact according to more specific points. For example, the most important *Time* dimension has at the lowest level calendar months. The calendar months are grouped into quarters and quarters into calendar years. So, we can get a value of a fact corresponding to a specific month. Going one level up in the dimension *Time*, we can get can get a value of the fact corresponding to a specific quarter and going even up we can get a value of the fact corresponding to a specific calendar year. If we donâ€™t specify any point in a dimension, it means we are interested in a value of a fact for all points together in the given dimension.


  AR-IMIS defines several dimensions. Their meaning is dependent on the context of a fact for which they are used. For example, for the fact *Number of submitted claims* the *Time* dimension means in AR-IMIS a period in which claimed health care was provided. It could have also other interpretations, for example, it may be a period in which claims were submitted. Exact interpretation of each dimension is indicated with description of each fact provided below.


  The points of a dimension are either fixed, e.g. the points *Sex* are *Male / Female / Undefined* for the dimension, or are obtained from registers in the operational part of IMIS. For example, the points for the dimension *Services* are obtained from the current status of the register of services in IMIS.


  The following table shows dimensions used across AR-IMIS. For each dimension its name, names of attributes used for referencing of their points, source for their points, and their meaning.
